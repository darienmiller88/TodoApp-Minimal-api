# Todo app using C# Minimal API

I'm introducing a new language into my tech stack: C#! Super happy with how the language functions: minimal api is EXTREMELY clean, but i'm a bit overwhelmed lol.

### Built With:
* [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
* [MongoDB-Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
* [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?icid=portal)
* [Razor Pages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-9.0&tabs=visual-studio)

### Requirements:

* Clone repo using `git clone https://github.com/darienmiller88/TodoApp-Minimal-api`
* Migrate the necessary information to your local `.env` as described in the `.env_sample` file
* Run `dotnet run`, or `dotnet watch run` to enable a server restart on change.
* `cd client` to access the Vue package, and run `npm run dev` to start vite server for Vue, which should be on port `5173`.
* Run `dotnet test` to run tests.

### What I learned:

When delving into this mini project, my goal was to build foundational knowledge using ASP.NET to build effective
and scable web applications in a brand language, as well as a new environment. The infrastructure, the tooling, the 
library, and the language features are all really cool! Here's what stood out:

#### Interesting quirks of C#

* Methods that return two value
* WebApplicationBuilder, which allows for the creation of a mega router
* Dependency injection
* Handler method parameters
* Razor Pages
* get and set keywords
* XUnit testing
* Extension member
* Named parameters
* Automatic response body binding to models
