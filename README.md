# Todo app using C# Minimal API

I'm introducing a new language into my tech stack: C#! Super happy with how the language functions: minimal api is EXTREMELY clean, but i'm a bit overwhelmed lol.

### Built With:
* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
* [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
* [MongoDB-Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

### Requirements:

* Clone repo using `git clone https://github.com/darienmiller88/TodoApp-Minimal-api`
* Migrate the necessary information to your local `.env` as described in the `.env_sample` file
* Run `dotnet run`, or `dotnet watch run` to enable a server restart on change.
* `cd client` to access the Vue package, and run `npm run dev` to start vite server for Vue, which should be on port `5173`.
